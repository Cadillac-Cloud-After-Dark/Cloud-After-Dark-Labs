## History of Linux

Linux was initially created as an open source alternative to Unix. You’re probably asking now.. Well what is Unix? Good question. Unix is a proprietary operating system created by a small team employed by Bell Labs (owned by AT&T) led by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s. Unix was derived from an operations system called [Multics]. Unix was considered as the first "portable" operating system mainly due to the fact it was written in the C programming language. Prior to Unix many operating systems were tied to physical hardware. 

In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free opensource UNIX-like operating system. It wasn't until 1991 when Linus Torvalds started a project that later became the Linux. 

## Unix vs Linux

It's easy to get confused between UNIX and Linux because in a way they look and feel similar. UNIX is a proprietary operating system, while LINUX is open source. For example many people think that MACOS is Linux, but it's actually a UNIX based OS. You can run bash shell scripts almost unchanged on both MacOS and Linux based systems.
