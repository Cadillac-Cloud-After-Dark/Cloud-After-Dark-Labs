## History of Linux

The goal of this readme is to give you a brief high level overview of Linux.

Linux was initially created as an open source alternative to Unix. You’re probably asking now.. Well what is Unix? Good question. Unix is a proprietary operating system created by a small team employed by Bell Labs (owned by AT&T) led by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s. Unix was derived from an operations system called [Multics]. Unix was considered as the first "portable" operating system mainly due to the fact it was written in the C programming language. Prior to Unix many operating systems were tied to physical hardware. 

In 1983, [Richard Stallman] started the [GNU] project with the goal of creating a free opensource UNIX-like operating system. It wasn't until 1991 when [Linus Torvalds] started a project that later became Linux. 

## Unix vs Linux

It's easy to get confused between UNIX and Linux because in a way they look and feel similar. UNIX is a proprietary operating system, while LINUX is open source. For example many people think that MACOS is Linux, but it's actually a UNIX based OS. You can run bash shell scripts almost unchanged on both MacOS and Linux based systems. 

## Debian vs RPM

When using Linux you can choose to install your applications with mainly 2 different package managers. A package manager keeps track of what software is installed on your machine. You can use a package manager to update/delete/add software on your machine. It's like the windows app store, but for Linux. The 2 most popular package managers are RPM (Redhat package manager) and Debian. 

Which one should you use? Well that depends. Different flavors of Linux are already preconfigured to use different package managers. 


Most popular Debian supported flavors:

👨🏾‍💻 Ubuntu

👨🏾‍💻 Linux Mint

👨🏾‍💻 KaliLinux

👨🏾‍💻 MX Linux

👨🏾‍💻 Deepin

👨🏾‍💻 Fedora Linux

👨🏾‍💻 Parrot OS

👨🏾‍💻 Arch Linux





Most popular RPM supported flavors:

👨🏾‍💻 Redhat

👨🏾‍💻 Fedora

👨🏾‍💻 CentOS

👨🏾‍💻 OpenSUSE

👨🏾‍💻 OpenMandriva

👨🏾‍💻 Oracle Linux



## Why Linux is important

Most of the tools that you are going to learn in these labs live on top of Linux. It's important to know basic commands because they bleed over into the commands you will need to know to use these "additional" tools. Also from an automation standpoint it is easy to pick up bash scripting if you already know some bash commands. In theory you are just adding some computer science conecpts on top of these shell commands in order to automate certain tasks. 

If you are going the DevOps route automating various process will be a part of your job. Although Bash scripting isn't an OOP (Object-oriented programming languge) it is still useful and powerful when it comes to automating in Linux/Unix.


## Setting up your machine 🖥

For these labs we will be using Ubuntu which is a Debian flavor of Linux (using an EC2 on AWS).

If you don't have access to a command line system (mac) the eaisest way to get started is:

🔥Windows - Install Ubuntu [WSL] 

OR:

🔥Spin up a Ubuntu VM in [AWS]/[GCP]/[AZURE]

OR:

🔥If you have [Docker] spin up a Ubuntu container


Happy learning!
