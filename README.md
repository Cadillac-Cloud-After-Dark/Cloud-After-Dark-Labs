## History of Linux

Linux was initially created as an open source alternative to Unix. You’re probably asking now.. Well what is Unix? Good question. Unix is a proprietary operating system created by a small team employed Bell Labs (owned by AT&T) led by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s. Unix was derived from an operations system called [Multics].
