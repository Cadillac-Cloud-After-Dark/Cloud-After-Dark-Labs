## History of Linux

Linux was initially created as an open source alternative to Unix. You’re probably asking now.. Well what is Unix? Good question. Unix is a proprietary operating system created by a small team employed by Bell Labs (owned by AT&T) led by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s. Unix was derived from an operations system called [Multics]. Unix was considered as the first "portable" operating system mainly due to the fact it was written in the C programming language. Prior to Unix many operating systems were tied to physical hardware.
