👉🏾 vi Sleep.txt

👉🏾 vi - Tells the system that you want to create/edit a file

👉🏾 Sleep.txt - Is the name of the file you want to create. 

🚨 If the file already exists the system will open that existing file and you will be able to view/edit the contents. If the file does not exist already in that directory the sysatem will create a new empty file for you in the editor.


## Common vi commands
Vi is a great tool for creating text files with multiple lines.

To inset text in vi press the "i" key. This will put you in INSERT mode. INSERT mode will allow you to add lines of text to a file. There will be an indicator at the bottom of the screen to confirm you are in insert mode.
