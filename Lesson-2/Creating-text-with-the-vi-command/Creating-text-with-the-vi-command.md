👉🏾 vi Sleep.txt

👉🏾 vi - Tells the system that you want to create/edit a file

👉🏾 Sleep.txt - Is the name of the file you want to create. 

🚨 If the file already exists the system will open that existing file and you will be able to view/edit the contents. If the file does not exist already in that directory the sysatem will create a new empty file for you in the editor.
