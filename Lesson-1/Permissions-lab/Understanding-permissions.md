## Overview

In this lab you will get familiar with permissions. 

## What are permissions?

Linux is a multi-user operating system. Permissions act as a security mechanism to prevent people from accessing each otherâ€™s confidential files. 

## How to see file permissions

We can view file permissions a couple different ways. The "ls" command is used to list files or directories.

As you can see ðŸ‘€ from the ls command the terminal prints out the file and directory names, but not any permissions information.

We can use the ls -l command to invoke the long list format. This is a fancy way of saying, we want more robust information about this directory and the files in it.
