## Users-and-Groups

Linux was designed to allow mulitple users to gain access to the system and files at the same time. For this multiuser design to work properly, Linux needs to use some type of method to protect users from each other. This brings us to "permissions". What are permissions? Good question :). Permissions associate each system file with an owner and a group and assigns access rights to that system file.

There are three different classes of users:

🥸 The file owner.
🏠 The group members.
🧍🏾 Others.

## Types of file permissions

Each user can be assigned anyone of these basic rights:

📖 Read: Allows the contents of the file to be viewed. 

✍🏾 Write: Let's a user modify the contents of that file. 

🔫 Execute: At the file level - Allows a entity to run the file and execute a program or script. At a directory level -  Allows you to change to a different directory and make it your current working directory.
