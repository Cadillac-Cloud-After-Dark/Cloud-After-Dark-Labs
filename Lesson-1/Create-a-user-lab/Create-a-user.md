## Overview

In this lab you will create a user. 

## What is a user?

👨🏾‍💻 A user can be defined as an entity. 

👨🏾‍💻 This entity can manipulate files and do other operations. 

👨🏾‍💻 Each user gets assigned an unique ID.


## Create a User
Let's create a user!

Command: 

sudo useradd "UserName"

## Verify your created User

Congrats! In the step above you created a new user using the useradd command. Now let's verify that we can see 👀 your user in your system. 
In Ubuntu you can see all users by typing cat /etc/passwd. As you can see all users live in the /etc/passwd directory (in Linux a directory is the equivelent to a folder 🗂 in windows).

Let's break this command down:

☞ "cat" 🙀 - The cat command reads data from the file and outputs the contents to your terminal. 

☞ /etc - is a directory. the /etc directory is where a Linux system's configuration files live.

☞ /passwd - is the directory that holds information about system users.


As you can see I can see the user I just created at the bottom of the screen.

## Passwd entry format

No you're probably wondering that is all that crap behind the user name I just created??? Let's take a closer look 🕵🏾‍♂️ ....
