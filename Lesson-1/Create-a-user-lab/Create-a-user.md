## Overview

In this lab you will create a user. 

## What is a user?

👨🏾‍💻 A user can be defined as an entity. 

👨🏾‍💻 This entity can manipulate files and do other operations. 

👨🏾‍💻 Each user gets assigned an unique ID.

## Root user

A root user in Linux is sometimes referred to as a "super user". This would be similar to an "administrator" in the windows environment. It is a user account for administrative purposes. Root users have the highest access rights on the system. Root users' accounts are simply referred to as "root".

Remember we had to type in "sudo" in previous labs in order to have the correct permission to run a command? If we were the root user we wouldn't have to add "sudo" to our command every time.

🚨Using root user can be dangerous.🚨 Superusers can do anything. Root should not be used unless absolutely necessary.


You can become root user by typing in the command: 


sudo su


Usually this will prompt you for a password.

Notice how the user changes from "ubuntu" to "root".

Let's take a closer look 👀 at this command:

👉🏾 sudo - means superuser do 

👉🏾 su - means switch user



## Create a User
Let's create a user!

Command: 

sudo useradd "UserName"

A closer look 👀:

⭐️ sudo - Allows you to run a single command as root

⭐️ useradd - creates a user

⭐️ UserName - Name of your user

## Verify your created User

Congrats! In the step above you created a new user using the useradd command. Now let's verify that we can see 👀 your user in your system. 
In Ubuntu you can see all users by typing:

💁🏾‍♂️ cat /etc/passwd

As you can see all users live in the /etc/passwd directory (in Linux a directory is the equivalent to a folder 🗂 in windows).

Let's break this command down:

☞ "cat" 🙀 - The cat command reads data from the file and outputs the contents to your terminal. 

☞ /etc - is a directory. the /etc directory is where a Linux system's configuration files live.

☞ /passwd - is the directory that holds information about system users.


As you can see I can see the user I just created at the bottom of the screen.

## Passwd entry format

No you're probably wondering what is all that crap behind the user name I just created??? Let's take a closer look 🕵🏾‍♂️ ....

CadillacBurgess - UserName

👉🏾 :x - indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file.

👉🏾 :1001 - User Id. Each user has a user ID number generated by the system.

👉🏾 :1001 - Primary group ID a list of group ids can be found in the /etc/group file.

👉🏾 :/home/CadillacBurgess - User's home directory. The path to the directory the user will be in when they log in.

👉🏾 :/bin/bash - The absolute path of a command or shell 

## Deleting a user

You can use the userdel command to delete a group in Linux

Let's take a closer look 🕵🏾‍♂️ at the format of this command:

👉🏾 sudo - allows us to run this command with root privileges

👉🏾 userdel - command to delete group

👉🏾 CadillacBurgess - the user name we want to delete
